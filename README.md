# The Modern American Savage

This article is not about the glories of the great American, of past or present, 
of name unsung or thoroughly celebrated. Instead, the spirit behind this article 
is a yearning to illustrate the deficits that plague laborious spirits and disintegrate 
common understanding. There are many classification schemes to describe the modern American 
savage. One simple binary approach is the expressive versus the non-expressive dichotomy, 
a divide that obviously does not fully describe the complexities of savagery but it makes 
for a good start. Here already, there are two schools of thought: talk little and make 
actions count, or talk much and talk about virtually anything for the truth or whatever 
and beyond. 

The modern American savage is no different than one from another land. This fact is a 
little insulting to the idea of American exceptionalism, if American exceptionalism is 
supposed to be the overhead characteristic of all characteristics to the land. But it 
makes for a great starting point. Modern American savages long for dysfunctional 
circumstances to afflict those that are more talented and moral than them. With 
dysfunctional circumstances comes the opportunity for them to really take charge, to 
seize the reins from the powers that were. This is a very rudimentary observation because 
the forging of civilization, no matter how technocratic or theocratic or somewhere in 
between, is for a systemic "product", a world that should be. Once the system morphs 
into questionable forms, and then serious questions are asked about serious shortcomings, 
there is the opening. The rise of a modern American savage, someone that perhaps stood by 
ideals through thick and thin and rain or shine despite the duplicity that they had to 
obscure to maintain the straight and steadfast posture. But once the obscurantism no 
longer suffices, they reflect on themself as an exposed one, so they then believe that 
they should no longer have to "hide" anything for their true form. A human being in a 
civilization, one that underwent civility processes, that is indeed a savage, a modern 
American savage at that.
