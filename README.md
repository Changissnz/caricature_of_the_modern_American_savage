# The Modern American Savage

This article is not about the glories of the great American, of past or present, 
of name unsung or thoroughly celebrated. Instead, the spirit behind this article 
is a yearning to illustrate the deficits that plague laborious spirits and disintegrate 
common understanding. There are many classification schemes to describe the modern American 
savage. One simple binary approach is the expressive versus the non-expressive dichotomy, 
a divide that obviously does not fully describe the complexities of savagery but it makes 
for a good start. Here already, there are two schools of thought: talk little and make 
actions count, or talk much and talk about virtually anything for the truth or whatever 
and beyond. 

The modern American savage is no different than one from another land. This fact is a 
little insulting to the idea of American exceptionalism, if American exceptionalism is 
supposed to be the overhead characteristic of all characteristics to the land. But it 
makes for a great starting point. Modern American savages long for dysfunctional 
circumstances to afflict those that are more talented and moral than them. With 
dysfunctional circumstances comes the opportunity for them to really take charge, to 
seize the reins from the powers that were. This is a very rudimentary observation because 
the forging of civilization, no matter how technocratic or theocratic or somewhere in 
between, is for a systemic "product", a world that should be. Once the system morphs 
into questionable forms, and then serious questions are asked about serious shortcomings, 
there is the opening. The rise of a modern American savage, someone that perhaps stood by 
ideals through thick and thin and rain or shine, once upon a time, despite the duplicity 
that they had to obscure to maintain the straight and steadfast posture. But once the 
obscurantism no longer suffices, they reflect on themself as an exposed one, so they then 
believe that they should no longer have to "hide" anything for their true form. A human being 
in a civilization, one that underwent civility processes, that is indeed a savage, a modern 
American savage at that. 

Now, a controversial notion on characterizing savagery is to be introduced. But beware that 
said notion is nothing unique; it has been spoken and written of on numerous occasions. The 
civilized savage kills with words, assassinates by putting pen to paper, and outsmarts their 
opponents that would have otherwise pulverized them. This is a dangerous notion because it 
appeals to a kind of populism that would kill for a stagnation in advances if it meant that 
"peace" and "norms" are preserved. Words, pens, and intelligence are only as dangerous as the 
rule over their users. Also, as a reminder, formal education is frequently associated with 
intelligence which, as anyone that has studied only a metaphorical ounce of history would 
know, is historically reserved for an upper-class, specifically, the ruling class. The signing 
of specific legislation into law can imperil certain peoples. Placing contracts on specific 
persons for "their own security" can, in fact, be euphemisms for their silent removal from 
society or the face of the Earth. Examples come and go, so this article will not exemplify 
on the previous two statements, and the attempt to characterize the modern American savage 
in essential terms continues. 

What makes the modern American savage distinctive enough to be placed into a distinct category, 
as opposed to Mongoloid or Negroid or Slavic savage, is that the norms of the US are relatively 
more commercial than many other nations. The commercial legacy of the US indeed made for a lot 
of misconceptions about it. Some nations did or do believe that the US was nothing more than a 
merchant's state, but these nations will not be specifically named here. With commerce, the 
erection, propagation, and maintenance of supply chains comprise cause for the inevitable one 
equilibrium of few bosses and many workers, these workers in some cases even regarded as "slaves", 
an archaic viewpoint but one that is as relevant today as the existing degrees of servitude and 
bondage of worker by boss, and also of course, the mentality of belief in it. The metric of commerce, 
alone, cannot possibly be the means to distinguish a great nation from a weak one. The independence of 
thought and autonomy in executive power also need to be considered in the context of commerce, for 
there are many that yearn for commercial success. But then commercial success comes to them and 
they are left with balancing out their priorities of sticking with the playbook or operating by 
their independent thought in their newfound position of affluence. A moral dilemma? Or is it a 
statesman's duty? 

Modern American savages focus their efforts on improving their appeal to the target audience. 
That is really a big reason why social ills remain. To operate in the shadows is too dark and 
there would be nothing to show for except for ends revealed too late. So modern American savages 
have a tendency to prefer operating in the light. Entertainment show business encourages these 
ones. From their perspective, they are what this fuel revolves around, an endless cycle empowering 
them for their domination as perpetual as public perception embraces them out to be. First 
impressions, presentability, persuasion all to centralize social understanding of them in 
monotonous terms prime for positive caricature. Models. Humiliation never stopped them. In fact, 
whatever games of humiliation was inflicted on them by those above, heretic or not, is carefully 
learned by them as part of legacy of executive power to continue. 

The modern American savage abuses the adage of "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words 
will never hurt me". This is undeniable. This writing's compatibility with the previous statement 
is hypocrisy that is also reminder and also, a hypocrisy that is based on personal circumstances.
