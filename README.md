# The Modern American Savage

This article is not about the glories of the great American, of past or present, 
of name unsung or thoroughly celebrated. Instead, the spirit behind this article 
is a yearning to illustrate the deficits that plague laborious spirits and disintegrates 
common understanding. There are many classification schemes to describe the modern American 
savage. One simple binary approach is the expressive versus the non-expressive dichotomy, 
a divide that obviously does not fully describe the complexities of savagery but it makes 
for a good start.
