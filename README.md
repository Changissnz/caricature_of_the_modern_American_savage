# The Modern American Savage

This article is not about the glories of the great American, of past or present, 
of name unsung or thoroughly celebrated. Instead, the spirit behind this article 
is a yearning to illustrate the deficits that plague laborious spirits and disintegrate 
common understanding. There are many classification schemes to describe the modern American 
savage. One simple binary approach is the expressive versus the non-expressive dichotomy, 
a divide that obviously does not fully describe the complexities of savagery but it makes 
for a good start. Here already, there are two schools of thought: talk little and make 
actions count, or talk much and talk about virtually anything for the truth or whatever 
and beyond. 

The modern American savage is no different than one from another land. This fact is a 
little insulting to the idea of American exceptionalism, if American exceptionalism is 
supposed to be the overhead characteristic of all characteristics to the land. But it 
makes for a great starting point. Modern American savages long for dysfunctional 
circumstances to afflict those that are more talented and moral than them. With 
dysfunctional circumstances comes the opportunity for them to really take charge, to 
seize the reins from the powers that were. This is a very rudimentary observation because 
the forging of civilization, no matter how technocratic or theocratic or somewhere in 
between, is for a systemic "product", a world that should be. Once the system morphs 
into questionable forms, and then serious questions are asked about serious shortcomings, 
there is the opening. The rise of a modern American savage, someone that perhaps stood by 
ideals through thick and thin and rain or shine, once upon a time, despite the duplicity 
that they had to obscure to maintain the straight and steadfast posture. But once the 
obscurantism no longer suffices, they reflect on themself as an exposed one, so they then 
believe that they should no longer have to "hide" anything for their true form. A human being 
in a civilization, one that underwent civility processes, that is indeed a savage, a modern 
American savage at that. 

Now, a controversial notion on characterizing savagery is to be introduced. But beware that 
said notion is nothing unique; it has been spoken and written of on several occasions. The 
civilized savage kills with words, assassinates by putting pen to paper, and outsmarts their 
opponents that would have otherwise pulverized them. This is a dangerous notion because it 
appeals to a kind of populism that would kill for a stagnation in advances if it meant that 
"peace" and "norms" are preserved. Words, pens, and intelligence are only as dangerous as the 
rule over their users. Also, as a reminder, formal education is frequently associated with 
intelligence which, as anyone that has studied only a metaphorical ounce of history would 
know, is historically reserved for an upper-class, specifically, the ruling class. The signing 
of specific legislation into law can imperil certain peoples. Placing contracts on specific 
persons for "their own security" can, in fact, be euphemisms for their silent removal from 
society or the face of the Earth. Examples come and go, so this article will not exemplify 
on the previous two statements, and the attempt to characterize the modern American savage 
in essential terms continues.
